                reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through
                a notice on our Platform. However, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We

                    Company may terminate your Account and your access to the Services if the Company finds your
                    application reasonable and acceptable. The Company is not obliged to provide the Services unless
                    required by applicable law. Therefore, the Company may terminate the Services in its entirety, or

                    needs not to provide you any notice before terminating or suspending your Account, but it may do
