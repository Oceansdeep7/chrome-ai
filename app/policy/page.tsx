                Policy</h2><p className="text-xl">It is the web's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
                information we may collect while operating our website. We respect your privacy and are committed to
                protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted
                this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how
                we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third
                parties.<br/>This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not
                apply to our collection of information from other sources. This Privacy Policy, together with the
                Terms and Conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your
                use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to
                agree to additional terms and conditions.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Website
                Visitors</h4><p className="text-xl">Like most website operators, our website collects
                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
                available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
                visitor request. Our website's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                understand how our website's visitors use its website. From time to time, our website may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
                usage of its website. Our website also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
                Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Our website only discloses logged in user and
                commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
                information as described below.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Security</h4><p
                className="text-xl">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no
                method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
                strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
                its absolute security.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Advertisements</h4><p
                className="text-xl">Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who
                may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
                online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
                most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our website and does not cover
                the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Links To External
                Sites</h4><p className="text-xl">Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated
                by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly
                advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit. We have no
                control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
                party sites, products or services.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Uses Google AdWords
                for remarketing</h4><p className="text-xl">Our website uses the remarketing services to advertise on
                third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we
                advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact
                form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results
                page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to
                serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with
                our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to
                you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based
                advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p><h4
                className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p
                className="text-xl">Our website discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
                know that information in order to process it on our website's behalf or to provide services available at
                our website's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our
                website's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Our website will not rent or
                sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to
                its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, our website discloses
                potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
                subpoena, court order or other governmental requests, or when our website believes in good faith that
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of our website, third parties or
                the public at large. If you are a registered user website and have supplied your email address, our
                website may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or
                just keep you up to date with what's going on with our website and our products. We primarily use our
                blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
                you send us a request (for example via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
                the right to publish it to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
                Our website takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
                alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                information.</p><h4 className="my-4 text-[1.5rem] font-bold">Aggregated Statistics</h4><p
